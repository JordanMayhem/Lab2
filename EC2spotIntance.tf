# The below code is for a spot instance fleet. Using lowestPrice allocation strategy 
# it will launch 2 spot instances in 2 different Availability Zones, in the same pool. We can implement 
# lowestPrice in combination with InstancePoolsToUseCount so that the fleet selects the Spot
# pools with the lowest price and launches Spot Instances across the number of Spot
# pools that we specify.  
  
# To create a cheap and diversified fleet, use the lowestPrice strategy in combination with
# InstancePoolsToUseCount. You can use a low or high number of Spot pools across which to
# allocate your Spot Instances. For example, if you run batch processing, we recommend specifying a 
# low number of Spot pools (for example, InstancePoolsToUseCount=2) to ensure that your queue always
# has compute capacity while maximizing savings. If you run a web service, we recommend specifying a
# high number of Spot pools (for example, InstancePoolsToUseCount=10) to minimize the impact if a 
# Spot Instance pool becomes temporarily unavailable.
